/**
 * Audit a doc for known quality defects. Returns warnings + structural info.
 * Never throws on a "bad" doc — lint is a signal, not a gate.
 *
 * Single-doc rules (missing preamble, undeclared inline mentions,
 * multi-parent, distillation candidates) and cross-doc rules (asymmetric
 * Parent/Child edges, sibling-assoc redundancy) both run here — this
 * tool loads the full vault index, so the cross-doc checks have the
 * context they need. The post-write fast paths in write_doc and
 * patch_section skip the cross-doc rules to stay cheap.
 *
 * Cross-doc resolution goes through the locality-aware resolveWikiLink,
 * so a `[[GBI-DAY3]]` link resolves via slug match to the file named
 * `GBI-DAY3.md` even though its H1 title is `GBI — DAY3`. A title-only
 * map (the previous implementation) would have left every such link
 * unresolved and falsely flagged the edges as asymmetric.
